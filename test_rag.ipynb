These systems require high investments which are returned through the heatsales . Due to the changed climate conditions and building renovation policies, heat demand in the future could decrease, \\nprolonging the investment return period. The main scope of this paper is to assess the feasibility of using the heat demand –outdoor tempe rature function for heat demand \\nforecast. The district of Alvalade, located in Lisbon (Portugal), was used as a case study. The district is consisted of 665 \\nbuildings that vary in both construction period and typology. Three weather scenarios (low, medium, high) and three district \\nrenovation scenarios were developed (shallow, intermediate, deep). To estimate the error, obtained heat demand values were \\ncompared with results from a dynamic heat demand model, previously developed and validated by the authors.\\nThe results showed that when only weather change is considered, the margin of error could be acceptable for some applications\\n(the error in annual demand was lower than 20% for all weather scenarios considered). However, after introducing renovation \\nscenar ios, the error value increased up to 59.5% (depending on the weather and renovation scenarios combination considered). \\nThe value of slope coefficient increased on average within the range of 3.8% up to 8% per decade, that corresponds to the decrease in the number of heating hours of 22-139h during the heating season (depending on the combination of weather and \\nrenovation scenarios considered). On the other hand, function intercept increased for 7.8-12.7% per decade (depending on the \\ncoupled scenarios). The values suggested could be used to modify the function parameters for the scenarios considered, and \\nimprove the accuracy of heat demand estimations.\\n©2017 The Authors.

Introduction  \\nBuildings are a strategic focus of European policies aiming to achieve a sustainable and competitive low -carbon \\neconomy. The European existing building stock is old and inefficient and renovated at a slow pace. Investing in \\nbuilding energy renovation is a crucial aspect not only for the derived savings and CO 2 emissions reduction, but also \\nfor other related benefits, such as job creation, fuel poverty alleviation, and energy security improvement. In the \\nframework of the European Directives, Member States (M S) have to develop and adopt specific actions to achieving \\nthe unrealized buildings energy saving potential. Several benefits are linked to this improvement, among them: \\nenergy security, job creation, fuel poverty alleviation, health and indoor comfort [1].  \\nEssential policy instruments that encourage energy efficiency retrofit measures and renewable energy production \\nare: the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED)  [2], the Energy Performance of Building Directive (EPBD and EPBD \\nrecast) [3, 4] and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED)  [5]. In particular, nearly zero energy buildings ( NZEB s) \\nrepresent the new building target from 2018 onwards. Achieving this target, especially for existing buildings, \\nrequires an appropriate combination of efficient technologies, sy stems and envelope solutions depending on location, \\nlegislation and market conditions. However, Member States present a wide range of building typologies and are \\ncharacterized by different technologies, climatic, and financial conditions. As a result, info rmation and data on \\nretrofit buildings, including costs, are not harmonised. There is the need for quantitative and comparable data and information that stimulate a large -scale diffusion of NZEB s in the market.  \\nBesides efforts to design new buildings havi ng low energy demand and availability of renewables, it is essential \\nto tackle the typically high energy consumption in existing buildings, characterized by an average age of about 55 years  [6]. The contribution of buildings to the total final energy consu mption in Europe was 40% in 2012, making \\nthe building stock responsible for 36% of the EU total CO2 emissions [7]. Few data are available on numbers, depth, \\nor trends in renovation rates in Europe. In 2011 renovation rate of the building stock per year was  assessed between \\n0.5% and 2.5% [8]. An average European renovation rate of 1% has been fixed, a value in line with the study carried \\nout for the European Commission  [9] where refurbishment rates of 1.2%, 0.9% and 0.5% per year were found for \\nNorth -Western  Europe, Southern Europe and new MS respectively.  The attention given to retrofit increased over the \\nlast decade and different retrofit definitions (e.g. minor, deep, major and NZEB s renovation) have been launched  \\n[10]. In particular, existing building re trofit towards NZEB s requires an appropriate combination of efficient \\ntechnologies, systems, renewables and envelope solutions depending on location, legislation and market conditions  \\n[11].  Quantitative and comparable data, as well as best practices, can help the diffusion of NZEB s across Europe.  \\n  2. European building policies  \\n The European policy framework aims at creating the conditions to improve energy efficiency of new and existing \\nbuildings.

The EED deals with a more efficient energy use throughout the energy chain, from its \\nproduction to its final consumption. It states that the public sector should purchase energy efficiency in buildings, \\nproducts and services. MS are required from 2014 to submit National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs), while Article 4 requires MS to establish a long -term strategy beyond 2020 for mob ilising investment in the \\nrenovation of residential and commercial buildings, with a view to improving the building stock energy performance [16]. The Directive introduces several measures, such as legal obligations to establish energy saving schemes in MS , \\nenergy efficiency national incentives, energy services and audits. According to the Directive, energy distributors or \\nretail energy sales companies have to achieve 1.5% energy savings per year through the implementation of energy \\nefficiency measures.  \\nThe RED Directive establishes a strategy for the production and promotion of energy from renewables in MS. \\nThis aspect is crucial in NZEB s as they combine high efficiency technologies with renewable production. The \\nDirective specifies national renewable energ y targets for each country, taking into account its starting point and \\noverall potential for renewable production. These targets range from 10% in Malta to 49% in Sweden.  \\nIn relation to policies on products, the Energy La belling Directive (2010/30/EU) [17 ] focuses on labelling and \\nstandard product information on energy consumption, while the Eco -design Directive (2009/125/EU) [18] creates \\nthe criteria for eco -design requirements identifying specific product categories. The indication given in both \\nDirectiv es are important as high efficiency appliances, products and systems have an impact on NZEB s energy \\nperformance.  \\n  2.1 Retrofit definitions  \\n The term “renovation” has been used to describe a wide variety of improvements to an existing building or group \\nof buildings. Different levels of renovation can be distinguished depending on the type of intervention and savings \\nobtained. Renovation can involve the installation of renewable energy sources (RES) as well as the replacement or upgrade of all building elem ents to reduce energy consumption towards zero levels. The refurbishment of a building \\nfaçade (i.e. walls and windows) provides a different energy saving level compared to the retrofit of the overall building envelope and systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning - HVAC, lighting, etc).  \\nAdopting BPIE parameters  [19], the energy performance of a building can be improved by the implementation of \\na single measure, such as a new heating system or roof insulation. Such interventions are referred to “sm all retrofit” \\nor “minor renovation”. Typically, energy savings of up to 30% might be expected by the application of one to three implemented measures.  \\nMany discussions have risen around the meaning of \"major\", “deep” and “ NZEB s” renovations [20].  \\nThe EED defines deep renovation as able to: “lead to a refurbishment that reduces both the delivered and the final \\nenergy consumption of a building by a significant percentage compared with the pre -renovation levels leading to a \\nvery high energy performance”. The European Parliament reported the following definition: “deep renovation means \\na refurbishment that reduces both the delivered and the final energy consumption of a building by at least 80% compared with the pre -renovation levels” [21]. In the Commission St aff Working Document  [22], it is stated that \\nMS should aim to encourage deep renovation of buildings leading to significant efficiency improvements, typically more than 60%.  \\nNZEB s renovation combines high efficiency technologies with renewable production  [23]. A reduction of \\nprimary energy demand is obtained through low -energy technologies (e.g. insulation, daylighting, high -efficiency \\nHVAC, natural ventilation, evaporative cooling) while RES can be on -site or off -site depending on the availability \\non site  (e.g. sun, wind) or to be transported to the site (e.g. biomass). A ranking of preferred application of different \\nrenewable supply side options is proposed by  [24]. On-site supply options use RES available within the building \\nfootprint or within the site (e.g. PV, solar hot water, low impact hydro, wind) while off -site options use RES \\navailable off -site to generate energy on -site (e.g. biomass, wood pellets, ethanol, biodiesel that can be imported, or \\nwaste streams used on -site to generate electricity and heat), or purchase off -site RES (e.g. utility -based wind, PV \\nemissions credits). The reduction of primary energy demand towards very low levels, also including RES, can lead to the avoidance of a traditional heating/cooling system  [25]. According to BPIE, between these two examples there \\nare renovations involving a varying number of upgrades. These can be subdivided into: “moderate”, involving 4 D\\'Agostino et al. / Energy Procedia 00 (2017 ) 000 –000 \\nimprovements (typically more than three) resulting in an energy reduction in the range from 30 to 60%; “deep”, related to the integration of high -grade improvements, able to reach energy savings from 60 to 90%.  \\nAs regards “major renovation”, it has been officially defined by the EPBD recast as: \"the renovation of a building \\nwhere: (a) the total cost of the renovation relating to the building envelope or the technical building systems is \\nhigher than 25% of the value of the building, excluding the value of the land upon which the building is situated; or (b) more than 25% of the surface of the building envelope undergoes  renovation; MS may choose to apply option (a) \\nor (b)\".  \\nThis definition identifies a window of possibilities, but probably it is inaccurate to compare the two terms, that \\nwere introduced by different legislative tools, i.e. EED and EPBD, and with different  objectives  [26]. In line with \\nthe EPBD recast, it is necessary to set a reference value to harmonize a certain level of renovation to the minimum energy requirement of new buildings. The Directive also asked for effective renovation and long -term strategy  for \\nmobilizing investments in building renovation to improve energy performances. According to the EED: \"Major \\nrenovations of existing buildings, regardless their size, provide an opportunity to take cost -effective measures  to \\nenhance energy performance\" .  \\nThe overlap between the meaning of \"deep renovation\" and \"major renovation\" should be avoided. Due to the \\nlack of a clear definition for deep renovation, confusion is often raised between the terms. Consequently, in future \\npolicy documents the term should be better defined or replaced by NZEB s renovation which is linked to national \\nNZEB s definitions. According to the EPBD recast, \"major renovation” has a legal implication in terms of building \\ncodes. On the other hand, a \"deep renovation\" does not carry lega l requirements. It presents a more pragmatic \\napproach that is focused on building envelope and systems to reduce energy consumption. The meaning of NZEB  \\nrenovation is not yet consolidated but it implies a new concept of renovation, having a holistic approa ch, which \\nconsiders the building lifecycle and its impact on the environment, which cannot exclude renewable production.  \\n  \\n2.2 Building databases  \\n \\n At European level there are several databases aimed at collecting data on buildings with different purposes.   \\nEurostat provides data for statistical analysis at different levels. The Buildings Performance Institute Europe \\n(BPIE) provides data on building stock of European countries. The database contains information on energy policy, energy uses, envelope, performance, systems, climatic zones, and the existing stock across Europe.  \\n The Odysee -Mure database, managed by Enerdata,  contains data on energy consumption drivers by end -use, \\nefficiency and CO\\n2 indicators. It allows a nalysis, interpretation and compar ison of energy consumption and \\nefficiency trends by sector for industry, transport and buildings. Data is regularly updated by European \\nrepresentatives, such as energy agencies, from all MS  [27]. The MURE (Mesures d\\'Utilisation Rationnelle de \\nl\\'Energie) da tabase provides information and data on energy efficiency policies and measures carried out in MS to \\nenable simulation and comparison of the potential impact of such measures at national level.  \\nThe Tabula web tool within the framework of the Intelligent E nergy Project Tabula (Typology Approach for \\nEnergy Building stock Assessment) gives data on building stocks, exemplary buildings, construction elements, energy consumption by energy carriers, and energy saving measures  [28].  \\nMultiple databases related to urban and energy information, such as National urban database, Eurostat - City \\nstatistics - Urban audit, Energy -cities case studies, can be used to support decision making for energy interventions \\nassessment in historical districts [29] . \\nThere are also dat a collections and programmes specifically focused on NZEB s. The Zebra data tool enables \\ndisplaying relevant indicators for NZEB s and high efficient buildings  [30]. This tool aims at providing information \\nof best practices in Europe, showing most frequent t echnologies, materials and strategies towards NZEB s. The tool \\ndifferentiates residential and non -residential NZEB  buildings and shows some of the most important indicators on \\nenergy performance, passive and active solutions and renewable energy production.   \\nA detailed database on high performing buildings in the Mediterranean climate has been developed by Rehva and \\nAircarr  to give practical guidelines to design NZEB s at European level  [31]. The aim of this data collection is to \\nfacilitate the NZEB s diffusi on giving detailed and complete information on high efficient buildings in \\nMediterranean countries.

The EED deals with a more efficient energy use throughout the energy chain, from its \\nproduction to its final consumption. It states that the public sector should purchase energy efficiency in buildings, \\nproducts and services. MS are required from 2014 to submit National Energy Efficiency Action Plans (NEEAPs), while Article 4 requires MS to establish a long -term strategy beyond 2020 for mob ilising investment in the \\nrenovation of residential and commercial buildings, with a view to improving the building stock energy performance [16]. The Directive introduces several measures, such as legal obligations to establish energy saving schemes in MS , \\nenergy efficiency national incentives, energy services and audits. According to the Directive, energy distributors or \\nretail energy sales companies have to achieve 1.5% energy savings per year through the implementation of energy \\nefficiency measures.  \\nThe RED Directive establishes a strategy for the production and promotion of energy from renewables in MS. \\nThis aspect is crucial in NZEB s as they combine high efficiency technologies with renewable production. The \\nDirective specifies national renewable energ y targets for each country, taking into account its starting point and \\noverall potential for renewable production. These targets range from 10% in Malta to 49% in Sweden.  \\nIn relation to policies on products, the Energy La belling Directive (2010/30/EU) [17 ] focuses on labelling and \\nstandard product information on energy consumption, while the Eco -design Directive (2009/125/EU) [18] creates \\nthe criteria for eco -design requirements identifying specific product categories. The indication given in both \\nDirectiv es are important as high efficiency appliances, products and systems have an impact on NZEB s energy \\nperformance.  \\n  2.1 Retrofit definitions  \\n The term “renovation” has been used to describe a wide variety of improvements to an existing building or group \\nof buildings. Different levels of renovation can be distinguished depending on the type of intervention and savings \\nobtained. Renovation can involve the installation of renewable energy sources (RES) as well as the replacement or upgrade of all building elem ents to reduce energy consumption towards zero levels. The refurbishment of a building \\nfaçade (i.e. walls and windows) provides a different energy saving level compared to the retrofit of the overall building envelope and systems (heating, ventilation and air conditioning - HVAC, lighting, etc).  \\nAdopting BPIE parameters  [19], the energy performance of a building can be improved by the implementation of \\na single measure, such as a new heating system or roof insulation. Such interventions are referred to “sm all retrofit” \\nor “minor renovation”. Typically, energy savings of up to 30% might be expected by the application of one to three implemented measures.  \\nMany discussions have risen around the meaning of \"major\", “deep” and “ NZEB s” renovations [20].  \\nThe EED defines deep renovation as able to: “lead to a refurbishment that reduces both the delivered and the final \\nenergy consumption of a building by a significant percentage compared with the pre -renovation levels leading to a \\nvery high energy performance”. The European Parliament reported the following definition: “deep renovation means \\na refurbishment that reduces both the delivered and the final energy consumption of a building by at least 80% compared with the pre -renovation levels” [21]. In the Commission St aff Working Document  [22], it is stated that \\nMS should aim to encourage deep renovation of buildings leading to significant efficiency improvements, typically more than 60%.  \\nNZEB s renovation combines high efficiency technologies with renewable production  [23]. A reduction of \\nprimary energy demand is obtained through low -energy technologies (e.g. insulation, daylighting, high -efficiency \\nHVAC, natural ventilation, evaporative cooling) while RES can be on -site or off -site depending on the availability \\non site  (e.g. sun, wind) or to be transported to the site (e.g. biomass). A ranking of preferred application of different \\nrenewable supply side options is proposed by  [24]. On-site supply options use RES available within the building \\nfootprint or within the site (e.g. PV, solar hot water, low impact hydro, wind) while off -site options use RES \\navailable off -site to generate energy on -site (e.g. biomass, wood pellets, ethanol, biodiesel that can be imported, or \\nwaste streams used on -site to generate electricity and heat), or purchase off -site RES (e.g. utility -based wind, PV \\nemissions credits).

Conclusions  \\nBuilding retrofit is one of biggest challenges that Europe is facing also because different typologies, climates, \\nconstruction materials and systems characterize its stock. The attention given to NZEB s increased over the last \\ndecade due to the great potential to decrease energy consumption and increase renewable production.  \\n NZEB  renovation implies a holistic approach, which considers the building lifecycle and its impact on the \\nenvironment, and comprises renewable production, while deep renovation ha s a more pragmatic approach mainly \\nfocused on reducing energy consumption.  A huge variability can be found accross Europe in relation to energy \\nperformance requirements and calculation methodologies related to NZEB s retrofit. The need of collecting \\nharmoni zed data to be shared and compared is fundamental to spread retrofit across MS. The NZEB s data collection \\nis a useful tool for stakeholders, researchers, policymakers, designers and building industries that can be inspired \\nfrom study cases and good practic es across Europe.  \\nThe database represents a user -friendly instrument to tackle the NZEB s retrofit progress in MS. It has to be \\nstressed that this is a first attempt to collect EU quantitative data on NZEB  retrofit buildings. The data collection \\nprovides k nowledge to better investigate the commonalities and the differences among NZEB s retrofit case studies \\nacross MS. In this way, it will contribute to identify common criteria to set up a EU wide definition of NZEB s \", metadata={'source': 'File_data/Criteria-and-structure-of-a-harmonised-data-collection-for-NZ_2017_Energy-Pr.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
