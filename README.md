The main files for both datset consists of implementation and results. The main files are as follows :

1. **SQuAD dataset - v1.1**
   - RAG_Squad.ipynb - consists of standard RAG implementation
   - clustering_benchmark_squad.ipynb - integration of clustering & topic-modeling in standard RAG

3. **RAG-12000 dataset- Neural Bridge**
   - neural_RAG.ipynb - consists of standard RAG implementation
   - neural_bridge_clustering.ipynb - integration of clustering & topic-modeling in standard RAG
