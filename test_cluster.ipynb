Based on the case studies of 63 OSS in the EU, we find that the approach has a potential to cover 5-6% of the renovation volume of 35 million buildings in 2030 set out by the Renovation Wave Strategy1,2 at low social costs, integrating private investments with client-friendly methods. The current level of activity of the European OSS market is estimated to be around 100 000 projects per year.\\nThe OSS can bridge the gap between a fragmented residential building sector, with a large heterogeneous set of households, and the construction supply side. They can help increase the actual renovation rate by supporting potential clients through the various steps of the decision-making process. Their success lies in part with their locally embedded focus, engagement with interested but not yet committed energy users/asset owners and ability to form strong relationships with clients. They can support the renovation journey from start to finish and can facilitate access to financing, occasionally offering better rates. While our analysis identifies several structural, legislative, financial, and information measures with a positive impact on OSS-enabled renovation projects, it is possible to enhance their contribution by reviewing specific policies that support or hinder their success. Although not typical of OSS in general, but with proper incentives, they can improve the average renovation depth in terms of energy performance level by adopting a holistic approach and, at the same time, they can reach out to vulnerable populations, such as tenants of social houses, thus contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty. Finally, OSS can contribute to the enhancement of communities and neighbourhoods. They help current tenants to improve their living conditions and thus stay in the area.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This report is the second part of a Europe-wide survey and assessment of one-stop shops (OSS) for energy renovation of buildings. Based on the case studies of 63 OSS in the EU, we find that the approach has a potential to cover 5-6% of the renovation volume of 35 million buildings in 2030 set out by the Renovation Wave Strategy1,2 at low social costs, integrating private investments with client-friendly methods. The current level of activity of the European OSS market is estimated to be around 100 000 projects per year.\\nThe OSS can bridge the gap between a fragmented residential building sector, with a large heterogeneous set of households, and the construction supply side. They can help increase the actual renovation rate by supporting potential clients through the various steps of the decision-making process. Their success lies in part with their locally embedded focus, engagement with interested but not yet committed energy users/asset owners and ability to form strong relationships with clients. They can support the renovation journey from start to finish and can facilitate access to financing, occasionally offering better rates. While our analysis identifies several structural, legislative, financial, and information measures with a positive impact on OSS-enabled renovation projects, it is possible to enhance their contribution by reviewing specific policies that support or hinder their success. Although not typical of OSS in general, but with proper incentives, they can improve the average renovation depth in terms of energy performance level by adopting a holistic approach and, at the same time, they can reach out to vulnerable populations, such as tenants of social houses, thus contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty. Finally, OSS can contribute to the enhancement of communities and neighbourhoods. They help current tenants to improve their living conditions and thus stay in the area.</td>\n",

       "0  This report is the second part of a Europe-wide survey and assessment of one-stop shops (OSS) for energy renovation of buildings. Based on the case studies of 63 OSS in the EU, we find that the approach has a potential to cover 5-6% of the renovation volume of 35 million buildings in 2030 set out by the Renovation Wave Strategy1,2 at low social costs, integrating private investments with client-friendly methods. The current level of activity of the European OSS market is estimated to be around 100 000 projects per year.\\nThe OSS can bridge the gap between a fragmented residential building sector, with a large heterogeneous set of households, and the construction supply side. They can help increase the actual renovation rate by supporting potential clients through the various steps of the decision-making process. Their success lies in part with their locally embedded focus, engagement with interested but not yet committed energy users/asset owners and ability to form strong relationships with clients. They can support the renovation journey from start to finish and can facilitate access to financing, occasionally offering better rates. While our analysis identifies several structural, legislative, financial, and information measures with a positive impact on OSS-enabled renovation projects, it is possible to enhance their contribution by reviewing specific policies that support or hinder their success. Although not typical of OSS in general, but with proper incentives, they can improve the average renovation depth in terms of energy performance level by adopting a holistic approach and, at the same time, they can reach out to vulnerable populations, such as tenants of social houses, thus contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty. Finally, OSS can contribute to the enhancement of communities and neighbourhoods. They help current tenants to improve their living conditions and thus stay in the area.   \n",

The study shows how improving insulation can reduce energy demand and drastically cut Russian oil and gas imports for heating in buildings. Investing in building renovation can reduce the use of fossil fuels for heating in buildings, reaching 44% in gas savings, save 45% of final energy demand and substantially contribute to securing the EU’s energy needs.   \n",

To inform this discussion, Climact and BPIE modelled the impacts of MEPS schemes on the European building stock. This allows comparing the ambition of MEPS as originally proposed by the European Commission with two other scenarios: the REPowerEU plan and a scenario aligned with the EU climate and energy consumption reduction targets set by Fitfor552. The modelling was done in June 2022 and mainly accounts for the proposals from the EU Commission, REPowerEU and the EP rapporteur for the EPBD revision, Ciáran Cuffe.   \n",

Sustained energy saving will increase the EU’s independence from fossil fuels.\\nTo tap into the full energy and fossil fuel savings potential, renovation activity in the residential sector must accelerate and increase in the next decade and continue until the full renovation of the building stock is achieved by 2050.\\nIt is now time to apply the energy efficiency first principle and give it real life by designing and implementing building renovation and decarbonisation policies to save energy and phase out fossil fuels. This shift will deliver substantial impact as shown by this study.\\nBoosting deep renovations now is the best way to protect citizens from being dependent on an unstable energy supplier, from being trapped in high energy bills, and from living in unhealthy buildings.   \n",

      "192  Given its large share of the total energy consumption in the EU (~40%), the building sector has a major role to play in the energy transition. However, the current average renovation rate in the EU is around 1% per year. This means that renovating the entire EU building stock would take roughly 100 years. Acceleration of the renovation rate requires new organisation and financing models. Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) are seen by many as perhaps the most promising model to boost the market. However, this model has fallen short of realising its potential. Perhaps the most challenging market for ESCOs is the housing market. In exactly this market, WDW has developed a very successful EPC model that has in a short time built a solid reputation in the Dutch market: The WoningAbonnement (WOAB)1 The DistrictEES project aims to realise an EPC-based renovation of three entire districts, financed by private investors. DistrictEES builds on the most successful EPC model of The Netherlands, loosely translated as ‘EnergyEfficiency Subscriptions’ DistrictEES provides private home owners, social housing associations, public building owners and commercial building owners with a tailor made District Level based solution to increase the conversion into energy efficient buildings The project will have significant impact on the market, both in terms of direct energy savings and in terms of the showcase element that comes with a district level renovation. Attracting private investors enables rapid replication and upscaling of the concept in The Netherlands and across the EU, the ultimate   \n",

Instead, it mentions that the context does not provide the necessary information. This is not in line with the reference answer, which directly provides the required information.\\n   \n",
       "3  The response is incorrect as it does not align with the reference answer. The reference answer clearly states that the objective of the optimization model is to maximize the Net Present Value (NPV) of the investigated technology portfolio. However, the response discusses the optimization of building energy performance and indoor environmental quality, which is not mentioned in the reference answer.    \n",
       "4       The response correctly identifies that the US aims to promote sustainable energy policies by capturing the multiple benefits of energy efficiency. However, it does not specifically mention spurring economic growth and environmental protection in a global context, which is a key part of the reference answer. Therefore, the response is not fully accurate or factual based on the reference answer.    \n",
