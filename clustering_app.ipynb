Based on the case studies of 63 OSS in the EU, we find that the approach has a potential to cover 5-6% of the renovation volume of 35 million buildings in 2030 set out by the Renovation Wave Strategy1,2 at low social costs, integrating private investments with client-friendly methods. The current level of activity of the European OSS market is estimated to be around 100 000 projects per year.\\nThe OSS can bridge the gap between a fragmented residential building sector, with a large heterogeneous set of households, and the construction supply side. They can help increase the actual renovation rate by supporting potential clients through the various steps of the decision-making process. Their success lies in part with their locally embedded focus, engagement with interested but not yet committed energy users/asset owners and ability to form strong relationships with clients. They can support the renovation journey from start to finish and can facilitate access to financing, occasionally offering better rates. While our analysis identifies several structural, legislative, financial, and information measures with a positive impact on OSS-enabled renovation projects, it is possible to enhance their contribution by reviewing specific policies that support or hinder their success. Although not typical of OSS in general, but with proper incentives, they can improve the average renovation depth in terms of energy performance level by adopting a holistic approach and, at the same time, they can reach out to vulnerable populations, such as tenants of social houses, thus contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty. Finally, OSS can contribute to the enhancement of communities and neighbourhoods. They help current tenants to improve their living conditions and thus stay in the area.</td>\n",

The EU is committed to a 55% reduction of\\ngreenhouse-gas emissions by 2030.1 The 2022 REPowerEU plan puts increased\\nemphasis on decarbonisation, notably through reducing energy demand\\nand futureproofing European infrastructure. There is significant potential\\nfor decarbonisation and energy reductions in the existing European building\\nstock to contribute to all these pressing goals, but new techniques are needed.\\nUsing prefabricated building components produced at an industrial scale (a\\nprocess known as industrial prefabrication) is one promising solution.   \n",

Although not typical of OSS in general, but with proper incentives, they can improve the average renovation depth in terms of energy performance level by adopting a holistic approach and, at the same time, they can reach out to vulnerable populations, such as tenants of social houses, thus contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty. Finally, OSS can contribute to the enhancement of communities and neighbourhoods. They help current tenants to improve their living conditions and thus stay in the area.   \n",

The study shows how improving insulation can reduce energy demand and drastically cut Russian oil and gas imports for heating in buildings. Investing in building renovation can reduce the use of fossil fuels for heating in buildings, reaching 44% in gas savings, save 45% of final energy demand and substantially contribute to securing the EU’s energy needs.   \n",

To inform this discussion, Climact and BPIE modelled the impacts of MEPS schemes on the European building stock. This allows comparing the ambition of MEPS as originally proposed by the European Commission with two other scenarios: the REPowerEU plan and a scenario aligned with the EU climate and energy consumption reduction targets set by Fitfor552. The modelling was done in June 2022 and mainly accounts for the proposals from the EU Commission, REPowerEU and the EP rapporteur for the EPBD revision, Ciáran Cuffe.   \n",
